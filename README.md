# Project Kilo - Universe

### Welcome to my personal homelab journal.

My goals with this homelab are few and many at the same time. I'm using this to learn, experiment, break, and learn some more. I've been playing with different forms of documentation and am learning to implement GitHub to hopefully do a better job of tracking changes.

### The setup

Main router: [Mikrotik hEX RB750Gr3](https://mikrotik.com/product/RB750Gr3) 
Second router: [Cisco Linksys EA4500](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/cisco-linksys-ea4500-review/) 

I run [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/) off a refurbished HP ProDesk 600 SFF and use a Synology DS220+ as my NAS. 

I've learned a bit over the last year or so of playing with the hEX and look forward to learning a lot more.

This repo and documents there-in are meant to grow with me as long as I decide to continue on this hobby. My goal is to document the architecture, config templates, and design decisions behind my homelab.

If you're a rookie like me, let's learn together. If you're more experienced, I'd love some feedback.
