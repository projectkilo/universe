# Project Kilo - Universe

## Welcome to my personal homelab journal.

**Project Kilo** is a long-term personal infrastructure project focused on replacing paid SaaS subscriptions with self-hosted, free and open-source software (FOSS), while building practical skills in networking, virtualization, and systems administration.

This repo and documents there-in are meant to grow with me as long as I decide to continue on this hobby. My goal is to document the architecture, config templates, and design decisions behind my homelab.

If you're a rookie like me, let's learn together. If you're more experienced, I'd love some feedback. 

## Main goal: 

Replace paid subscription services with self-hosted free and open-source alternatives where practical.

## Secondary goals: 

- Learn network engineering and system admin concepts and technologies: 
	- IPTV 
	- RouterOS (MikroTik) 
	- OpenWRT 
	- VLAN design and segmentation 
	- VoIP 
- Learn server and infrastructure management: 
	- Cloud / Network Attached Storage 
	- Containerization (Docker) 
	- Virtualization (Proxmox)
